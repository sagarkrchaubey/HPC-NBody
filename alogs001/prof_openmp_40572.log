        Spin Time: 52.829s
         | A significant portion of CPU time is spent waiting. Use this metric
         | to discover which synchronizations are spinning. Consider adjusting
         | spin wait parameters, changing the lock implementation (for example,
         | by backing off then descheduling), or adjusting the synchronization
         | granularity.

            Imbalance or Serial Spinning: 52.829s
             | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance
             | or serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time.
             | This can be caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency
             | for all working threads, or busy waits of worker threads while
             | serial code is executed. If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic
             | work scheduling or reduce the size of work chunks or tasks. If
             | there is insufficient concurrency, consider collapsing the outer
             | and inner loops. If there is a wait for completion of serial
             | code, explore options for parallelization with Intel Advisor,
             | algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
             | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or
             | Microarchitecture Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP*
             | applications, use the Per-Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric
             | set in the HPC Performance Characterization analysis to discover
             | the reason for high imbalance or serial spin time.
