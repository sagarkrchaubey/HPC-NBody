Effective CPU Utilization: 2.1%
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
